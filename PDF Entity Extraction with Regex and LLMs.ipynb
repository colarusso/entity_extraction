    "\n",
    "One can use this notebook to build a pipeline to parse and extract data from OCRed PDF files. **Warining:** When using LLMs for entity extraction, be sure to perform extensive quality control. They are very susceptible to distracting language (latching on to text that sound \"kind of like\" what you're looking for) and missing language (making up content to fill any holes), and importantly, they do **NOT** provide any hints to when they may be erroring. \n",

You can do this uncommenting the line bellow that reads `#!pip install mod_name` if it's listed. If it isn't, you can probably install it with a similarly formatted command. "

The Board of Appeal held a public hearing on the appeal on April 9, 2019 and found that the proposed project is an appropriate use of the lot and will not adversely affect the community or create any detriment for abutting residents.
