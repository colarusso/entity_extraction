    "# Sample Notebook for Extracting Data from OCRed PDFs Using Regex and LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "One can use this notebook to build a pipeline to parse and extract data from OCRed PDF files. _**Warning:** When using LLMs for entity extraction, be sure to perform extensive quality control. They are very susceptible to distracting language (latching on to text that sound \"kind of like\" what you're looking for) and missing language (making up content to fill any holes), and importantly, they do **NOT** provide any hints to when they may be erroring. You need to make sure random audits are part of your workflow!_ Below we've worked out a workflow using regular expressions and LLMs to parse data from zoning board orders, but the process is generalizable.\n",

    "First we load the libraries we need. Note, if you try to run the cell, and you get something like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mod_name'`, you'll need to install the module. You can do this commentating the line below that reads `#!pip install mod_name` if it's listed. If it isn't, you can probably install it with a similarly formatted command. "
