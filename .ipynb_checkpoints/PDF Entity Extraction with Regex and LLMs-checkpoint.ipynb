    "One can use this notebook to build a pipeline to parse and extract data from OCRed PDF files. **Warining:** When using LLMs for entity extraction, be sure to perform extensive quality control. They are very susceptible to distracting language (latching on to text that sound \"kind of like\" what you're looking for) and missing language (making up content to fill any holes), and importantly, they do **NOT** provide many hints to when they may be erroring. \n",

You can do this uncommenting the line bellow that reads `#!pip install mod_name` if it's listed. If it isn't, you can probably install it with a similarly formatted command. "
